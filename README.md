# Forum
A simple forum I made in less than 24h as a challenge.

## Get started
* Step 1
```
git clone https://github.com/1Mihail/SimpleForum.git
```

* Step 2 - Go to [Web.config](https://github.com/1Mihail/SimpleForum/blob/master/Web.config) and replace %PATH% with the new correct path. (line 37)

* Step 3 - Import and run the project.

## TODO
* Encrypt passwords.
* Redesign roles schema.
* Create confirmation for deletions.
